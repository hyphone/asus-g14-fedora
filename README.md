# Fedora 33 Setup with an ASUS Zephyrus G14 GA401IV

---

This Git repo describes how I setup the ASUS Zephyrus G14 (GA401IV) with Fedora 33 including a GNOME Shell extension to switch between GPUs and ROG profiles.

## Installation process

**1. Install Fedora 33**

**2. Boot to your installation and update everything**

```bash
dnf update
dnf install tlp tlp-rdw brightnessctl
```

> tlp is used for automatic power management for some hardware components (so you don't have to powertop --auto-tune)
> brightnessctl is used for controlling the keyboard backlight before and after suspend as there is a bug that the keyboard backlight sometimes does not switch completely off while suspending.

**3. Reboot**

**4. copy all the files to the appropriate directories**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyphone/asus-g14-fedora.git
cd asus-g14-fedora
cp -R etc/* /etc/
cp -R usr/* /usr/
chmod +x /usr/sbin/asusboot
chmod a+x /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/asus_keyboard_backlight
```
> we clone this repo

> we go to the repo directory

> we copy everything in this repo of etc to /etc/

> we copy everything in this repo of usr to /usr/

> we make the script /usr/sbin/asusboot executable

**5. Update the repos and install some packages**
```bash
dnf update
```

**5.1 reboot to make sure you are on the newest Kernel**
```bash
reboot
```

**5.2 install some packages**
```bash
dnf install kernel-devel akmod-nvidia xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda asus-nb-ctrl dkms-hid-asus-rog dkms-asus-rog-nb-wmi akmod-acpi_call
```

> akmod-nvidia and xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda installs the Nvidia driver

> asus-nb-ctrl dkms-hid-asus-rog dkms-asus-rog-nb-wmi installs the currently necesary Kernel modules from asus-linux.org to get the function keys and custom fan control working

> kernel-devel is necesarry for the dynamic kernel modules to compile

> acpi_call modules from the tlp repo is needed to make the custom fan control working

**6. Enable the custom services**

```bash
systemctl enable asusboot.service
```

> asusboot.service removes and adds again the i2c_hid modules because on Fedora 33 the touchpad sometimes is not initialized correctly on boot. This fixes this.

**5. Reboot**

**6. You can switch AMD / Nvidia on demand via the gnome extension or with "asusctl graphics -m (graphics mode)"**

## What's in here...

```
etc/asusd/asusd.conf
```
These are my custom fan curves for the asusd service from asus-linux.org.
When on AC I usually use "normal" because of turbo is enabled with the default silent fan profile of the laptop.
On "silent" I disabled turbo and I usually use this while on battery. This has a custom fan curve to make it silent.

```
etc/modprobe.d/asus.conf
```
Enables Nvidia power management and blacklists conflicting modules


```
etc/systemd/system/asusboot.service
```
removes and adds again the i2c_hid modules because on Fedora 32 the touchpad sometimes is not initialized correctly on boot. This fixes this.

```
etc/tlp.conf
```
marginal adjusted tlp configuration with the CPU gonvenor set to "ondemand" on AC and "powersave" on BAT.
Also max CPU frequency on BAT is limited to 1,7GHz.

```
usr/sbin/asusboot
```
called by asusboot.service, gets called on boot and resets the i2c_hid modules because on Fedora 33 the touchpad sometimes is not initialized correctly on boot. This fixes this.
